### Portland Metro Area

[Source](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/portland-region-nears-24-million-residents-growing-41000-last-year)

Population (2015): 2,389,228

The Portland Metro Area is the largest concentration of people in the state of Oregon, and is one of the fastest growing places in the state as well.



Largest city by county?

explain: If one were to look at the largest cities in Oregon, most of them are in the Portland Metro Area, leaving nearly 1.5 million people out of the story. By looking at the largest city per county, this shows less of a Portland-centric or Willamette Valley-centric view of the state of Oregon, which is very common.
